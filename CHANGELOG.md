# Change Log

## v1.3.0

### **New Features**

#### **Gherkin/Feature File Support:**

The extension now supports **Gherkin syntax** for `.feature` files, allowing you to associate Gherkin Scenarios with Azure DevOps test cases.

**Supported Gherkin Elements:**
- `Scenario: <scenario name>` - Standard scenarios  
- `Scenario Outline: <scenario name>` - Parameterized scenarios

**Comment Format for Gherkin:**
In `.feature` files, use hash (`#`) comments to specify ADO_IDs:

```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication

  # ADO_IDs: TC_123
  Scenario: User can login with valid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When they enter valid credentials  
    Then they should be redirected to dashboard

  # ADO_IDs: TC_124, TC_125
  Scenario Outline: User login with different credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When they enter <username> and <password>
    Then they should see an error message
    
    Examples:
      | username | password |
      | invalid  | invalid  |
      | valid    | invalid  |
```

**How to Use with Gherkin:**

1. In your `.feature` file, add hash comments with ADO_IDs above scenario lines
2. Click on any `Scenario:` or `Scenario Outline:` line
3. Right-click to access association commands, or use the `Associate IDs from Comments` command
4. The extension will extract scenario names and associate them with Azure Test Cases

**Improvements:**
- **Enhanced language detection:** The extension now properly detects and handles Gherkin language files
- **Context menu support:** Right-click context menu now appears when clicking on Gherkin scenario lines
- **Automatic scenario extraction:** Scenario names are automatically extracted for association with Azure DevOps

## v1.2.2

### Bug Fixes:
- **Fixed issue with decorations not persisting when switching between files:** Previously, when switching between files that had decorations, the decorations would be lost. This issue has been resolved, and decorations are now properly maintained even when navigating between files.

- **Fixed issue with decorations being applied to the wrong file when toggling Show/Hide:** When toggling the "Show/Hide" action, the decorations were being applied to the wrong file (the file where the user left). Now, the decorations are correctly applied only to the active file, preventing unwanted appearance/disappearance of decorations on other files.

- **Fixed issue where decorations from a test with ADO_IDs were applied to the next test without ADO_IDs:** Previously, if a test case had ADO_IDs and the test below it didn't have ADO_IDs, the decoration from the test above would incorrectly appear on the second test. This has been fixed so that tests without ADO_IDs do not inherit decorations from tests above them that have ADO_IDs.

- **Fixed issue with decorations not updating correctly when new IDs are added:** Previously, when new ADO_IDs were added to the test case, the decorations wouldn't update. Now, the decorations correctly reflect the newly added IDs.

- **Resolved problem with removed IDs still showing in decorations:** When an ID is removed from the test case, it no longer appears in the decorations. The cache and editor decorations are properly updated to reflect the removal of IDs.

### Improvements:
- **Improved cache and decoration management:** The cache is now properly updated when test case IDs are added or removed. Decorations are correctly re-applied after each change, ensuring that only valid, associated IDs are displayed, while removed or invalid IDs are no longer shown. This ensures the proper handling of both associated and unassociated test case IDs in the editor.

## v1.2.0

### **New Features** 

### **Command for Associating Tests:**

A new command has been added to automatically associate automated tests with code blocks based on the comment containing the `ADO_IDs: TC_1234, TC_4321` pattern. The command scans the code, finds the mentioned test IDs and associates them to **Azure Test Case**.


To associate tests with a code block, insert a comment like:

Javascript/Typescript
```javascript
// ADO_IDs: TC_1234, TC_5678
test('Your Scenario Name', async () => {
  // Your Code Here
});

// Or 

// ADO_IDs: TC_1234, TC_5678
it('Your Scenario Name', async () => {
  // Your Code Here
});
``` 

Python
```python
# ADO_IDs: TC_1234, TC_5678 (Could be here)
@pytest.mark.parametrize("input, expected", [
    (1, 2),
    (2, 4), 
])
# ADO_IDs: TC_1234, TC_5678 (Or Could be here)
def test_scenario_name(page: Page):
    ## Your Code Hwere
```
This indicates that the tests with IDs TC_1234 and TC_5678 can be associated to Azure Test Case easier via `Associate IDs from Comments` command.

**How to Use:**

1. In the test file, add the ***comments*** with the test IDs in the format `ADO_IDs: TC_1234, TC_5678` above the test function.
2. Run the `Associate IDs from Comments` command in VS Code and select the `Test Type`.
    - The system will look for comments with the ***ADO_IDs*** pattern and automatically associate the automated tests with the corresponding IDs to ***Azure Test Case***.


### **Visualizing Associations:**

Test lines with associated tests will be highlighted with a green decoration showing `✓ Associated (TC_1234, TC_4321)` next to the line.
Code lines without associated tests will be highlighted with a red decoration showing `✗ Unassociated (TC_9876)`.
The associations are visually displayed within the editor, making it easy to see which lines are already associated with some **Azure Test Case.**

**How to Use:**

1. In the test file, run the `View/Hide All Associated Automated Tests` command.
2. Look at your code. Lines of code associated with test cases will have a green indicator `✓ Associated`, and unassociated lines will have a red indicator `✗ Unassociated`.
3. To Hide the labels that is being displayed, run the `View/Hide All Associated Automated Tests` command again.

**Note:** If you update the content (e.g., add new comments or modify the existing associations), the decorations may not immediately reflect the changes.
To refresh and view the updated associations, use the `View/Hide All Associated Automated Tests` command again. This will ensure that the editor correctly refreshes the state and displays the new associations or updates. 

## v1.1.0
### Added

- **Python support:** The extension now recognizes test functions in Python, specifically those defined with `def test_`.
    - Added mechanism to detect `def test_` pattern for Python files.
    - Now extracts the test case name from Python methods (e.g., `def test_scenario_title`).

### Improved
- **Test name extraction:** Enhanced test name extraction to support both JavaScript/TypeScript (`test() or it()`) and Python (`def test_`).

## v1.0.0

Initial release of azure-test-track-vscode-extension with basic functionality to associate tests with Azure DevOps test cases.
